-- Check if we need to create missing auth users for existing profiles
-- This is a one-time fix for profiles that exist without corresponding auth users

-- Note: This cannot directly create auth users via SQL as auth.users is managed by Supabase Auth
-- The user will need to:
-- 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
-- 2. Click "Add user" 
-- 3. Enter: anendel@gmail.com with the correct password
-- 4. Set email_confirmed to true

-- Or use the Auth UI to sign up normally with email verification
